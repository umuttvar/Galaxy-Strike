# Galaxy Strike

Galaxy Strike is a space shooter game built in Unity. The player follows a predetermined path while engaging enemy ships using a laser weapon.

* If the player collides with an enemy or any terrain object, the game ends and restarts.
* Each destroyed enemy rewards the player with points.

## Features & Gameplay

* The player uses a laser to destroy enemies while avoiding obstacles.
* Collisions with enemies or terrain objects result in game over.
* Points are earned for every enemy destroyed.

* Camera angle adjustments for cinematic view
* Animation workflow in Unity
* **Quaternion rotation** for aligning lasers with the crosshair
* Dialogue system integration
* UI Canvas setup for crosshair and scoreboard
* Prefab usage and prefab variants for efficient workflow
